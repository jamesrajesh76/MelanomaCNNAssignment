# Melanoma CNN Assignment
> Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. This project aims to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. 
- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
This project aims to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 
- What is the dataset that is being used?
Roughly 2250 images of skin cancer cells are provided with classes indicating the type of skin cancer. Another 100 images are provided to test the CNN model.


## Conclusions
